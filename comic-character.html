      <div class="character-description">
        <p>
        Kyshumu Blaise is the Chief of the ReNet Network and number 1 ranked Cybervator. He is impulsive and mistrustful but loyal and protective towards those he cares about. Although he is a Chief he still tries to fight every chance he gets so that he can retain his number one ranking.
        </p>
        <p>
        When Kyshumu fights –while going into burst drive mode–he pounces into action and roars with a glass shattering battle cry thanks to his lion-leopard he synergizes with.
        </p>
        <p>
        He originally started with just a leopard Cyber.Beast but was given a lion cyberbeast by he his wife Tomasina as a courting gift. He now uses a Lion-Leopard hybrid combined with his fire element and strength ability. This enables him have unorthodox fighting style, in that although his specialty is strength he combines it with his fire element to generate power in short bursts. This gives him incredible jumping ability allowing him to be as fast as most speed type cybervators and jump as high as many flying types can fly.
